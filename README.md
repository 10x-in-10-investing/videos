# Welcome to 10x in 10 Investing!
## Video GitHub Repo


### Summary

10x in 10 investing has the goal of providing the necessary tools and knowledge to empower you to discover and discern a company's capacity to 10x in 10 years.  This repository has been created as a resource to further that goal.  Currently all video's can be found on the [10x in 10 Investing YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFduxUAQ9dC8VLQ-kIkcTvg).

Each video addresses a single topic.  It may be a general topic, such as the first video, which discusses the 5 keys ideas of the 10x in 10 investing mindset. It may be about a specific topic such as presenting a valuation model for valuing stocks.  Finally, it may address a specific company.  All videos are educational and never recommend a specific investment action.

Videos are intentionally short and concise, generally introducing the core topic.  They are meant to induce interested viewers to extend their knowledge base.  And that's the primary value of this repository.  This repository goes beyond archiving the resources mentioned in the videos by providing deeper analyses and more complex spreadsheets, models and scripts.

Your contribution will be helpful; however, I suggest reaching out to me, Bill, before spending too much time.  Please leave a comment in one of the recent YouTube videos if you have additional topic ideas. 


### Organization

Video resources are contained in the `video-resources` subdirectory.  A subdirectory has been created for each video's resources. Subdirectories are listed sequentially by date completed.  A summary of each video is provided and a link to view it.  In general, video resources contain the links, spreadsheets, scripts and underlying data, as applicable, discussed in the video.  Additional resources specific to the topic discussed are contained in these subdirectories as well.
