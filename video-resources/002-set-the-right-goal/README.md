### Summary

Your investment goal is important and should be well defined and front of mind.  The goal for 10x in 10 investing is a 25.9% annual return objective with a 10-year timeframe, which is succinctly summarized in the mnemonic, 10x in 10.

This video argues 10x in 10 sets a meaningful, yet achievable, return objective and a 10-year timeframe is a good investment horizon for owning specific investments.
