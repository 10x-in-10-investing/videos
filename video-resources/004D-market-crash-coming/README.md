## See the video on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/cZxxU2OdMLg)

### 


### Summary


The probability of a market crash over the next year is presented based on a price/ normalized earnings (P/E ratio) model for the S&P 500.  In addition, the probabilities of other 1- and 10-year outcomes are presented as well.

### Tools

R script (004-D-the-crash.R) fits a hierarchical linear model to predict 1- and 10-year future returns given the current P/E ratio.  The P/E must be estimated as earnings are based on normalized ("trendline") earnings, which is never known.  S&P 500 index data is obtained from [Dr. Shiller's website](http://www.econ.yale.edu/~shiller/data.htm).  Refer to script and .stan file for more details.
