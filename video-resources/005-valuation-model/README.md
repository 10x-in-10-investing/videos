### Summary


10x in 10 investors invest in companies with an expected 10x in 10 outcome.  That happens when the proceeds from the sale plus the dividends received exceed 10 times what you paid for it.

This video presents a simple model that directly calculates whether a 10x in 10 outcome is expected.  The video walks through the mechanics of the model using Microsoft as an example.

### Tools

The Excel (valuation-model-video.xlsx) contains the valuation model.  The model is self-contained in the "Model" tab.  The "Scenarios" and "FinStmts" tab show how the assumptions were derived and the underlying financial statement data.  The financial statement data was obtained from [QuickFS](https://quickfs.net/).
