### Summary

10x in 10 investing has the goal of providing the necessary tools and knowledge to empower you to discover and discern a company's capacity to 10x in 10 years.  This video introduces the 10x in 10 investing mindset, which encompasses 5 key ideas:

* 10x in 10 -- It's the goal, which is captured in the easy to remember mnemonic "10x in 10".  It has two components: return and time.  The return objective is a 25.9% compound annual return;  the time-frame is 10 years.  Put the two together, a 25.9% annual return over 10 years, and your investment 10x's (for example, goes from $10,000 to $100,000 over 10 years).  Our goal is to invest in and hold a concentrated portfolio of companies that will 10x in 10 several times over a lifetime.

* Discovery -- The idea behind discovery is open mindedness; look at investing from a different perspective and always be ready to explore new ideas.

* Discernment -- Discernment is the ability to judge well, which takes experience, discipline and knowledge.  It's about identifying and focusing on the information that determines whether a company will 10x in 10 or not.

* Capacity -- The idea a company must have the ability to grow sufficiently to make it possible to 10x in 10. 

* Empowerment -- The idea you should take control over your investments by gaining the knowledge and skill to achieve the 10x in 10 goal.



### Tools

An Excel spreadsheet (001-10x-in-10-examples.xlsx) was created for the graphic showing the idea of growing a 10x in 10 portfolio over a lifetime.  The starting value, annual return and 10x in 10 count inputs can be changed and the values in Column D will calculate properly based on those inputs.  However, keep the following in mind:

* The plot may need to be adjusted.

* The 25.9% default value is a formula "=10^(1/10)-1" so that you get exactly 10 times the starting value every 10 years.

* The number of years calculated equals 10x in 10 count input value times 10.  For example, enter a 2 and 20 years will be calculated.
